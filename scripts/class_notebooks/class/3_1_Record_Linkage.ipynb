    "## The Principles of Record Linkage\n",
    "The goal of record linkage is to determine if pairs of records describe the same identity. For instance, this is important for removing duplicates from a data source or joining two separate data sources together. Record linkage also goes by the terms data matching, merge/purge, duplication detection, de-duping, reference matching, entity resolution, disambiguation, co-reference/anaphora in various fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to record linkage that include \n",
    "    - exact matching, \n",
    "    - rule-based linking and \n",
    "    - probabilistic linking. \n",
    "- An example of **exact matching** is joining records based on social security number. This is what you already have done in SQL by joining tables by an unique identifier. \n",
    "- **Rule-based matching** involves applying a cascading set of rules that reflect the domain knowledge of the - records being linked. \n",
    "- In **probabilistic record linkages**, linkage weights are estimated to calculate the probability of a certain match.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical applications you will need record linkage techiques to combine information addressing the same entity that is stored in different data sources. Record linkage will also help you to address the quality of different data sources. For example, if one of your databases has missing values you might be able to fill those by finding an identical pair in a different data source. Overall, the main applications of record linkage are\n",
    "    1. Merging two or more data files \n",
    "    2. Identifying the intersection of the two data sets \n",
    "    3. Updating data files (with the data row of the other data files) and imputing missing data\n",
    "    4. Entity disambiguation and de-duplication"

    "\n",
    "- **Approach**: We will look at the data available to us- and clean & pre-process it to enable better linkage.

    "\n",
    "**Variables Used**:\n",
    "- Name_legal (legal name of the firm)\n",
    "- Address (concatenated the different address strings such as house number, street address, etc to have one variable)\n",
    "- Setup Date: concatenated the day, month & time to get one date variable which refers to the setup of the establishment in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Filter Applied**: for the purposes of this exercise, we also removed certain records with the following criterion: \n",
    "- All records which have a unique combination of ein & name_legal... This means any record for which one ein is linked to only one name_legal is not a part of this dataset.\n",
    "- All records which have a null value for address or setup_date\n",
    "- For 2005 data in particular, for some records, we have character values (A-Z) in the variable holding #employees. We have removed such records. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a last step, we drew a sample which ensures a certain degree of deterministic name matching between the two datasets for 2005 & 2015, to make sure we have enough matches in the data for this exercise. \n",

    "For our case study we already prepared some data for you. In order to demostrate record linkage we need directly identifiable data. In typical applications you would link based on names or some account numbers. We can't do this in class because the data in the ADRF is de-identified to guarantee data privacy for individuals who are in the data. Thus we need some other kind of information which can be linked. The QCEW (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages) files we have for Illinois however contain names of employer. Thus, we prepared a subsample of the QCEW data for the years 2005 & 2015-- consisting of legal name, physical address, and some other establishment characteristics (see [Data Description](#Data-Description)).

    "\n",
    "Linking records from different data sources comes with different challenges that need to be addressed by the analyst. The analyst must determine whether or not two entities (individuals, businesses, geographical units) on two different files are the same. This determination is not always easy. In most of the cases there is no common uniquely identifing characteristic for a entity. For example, is Bob Miller from New Yor the same person as Bob Miller from Chicago in a given dataset? This detemination has to be executed carefully because consequences of wrong linkages may be substantial (is person X the same person as the person X on the list of identified terrorists). Pre-processing can help to make better informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-processing can be difficult because there are a lot of things to keep in mind. For example, data input errors, such as typos, misspellings, truncation, abbreviations, and missing values need to be corrected. Literature shows that preprocessing can improve matches. In some situations, 90% of the improvement in matching efficiency may be due to preprocessing. The most common reason why matching projects fail is lack of time and resources for data cleaning. \n",

    "### Regular Expressions - regex\n",
    "When defining a regular expression search pattern, it is a good idea to start out by writing down, explicitly, in plain English, what you are trying to search for and exactly how you identify when you've found a match.\n",
    "For example, if we look at an author field formatted as \"<last_name> , <first_name> <middle_name>\", in plain English, this is how I would explain where to find the last name: \"starting from the beginning of the line, take all the characters until you see a comma.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can build a regular expression that captures this idea from the following components:\n",
    "- ^ Matches beginning of the line\n",
    "- . Matches any character\n",
    "- .+ A modifier that means \"match one or more of the preceding expression\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regular expression, there are special reserved characters and character classes like those in the list above. Anything that is not a special character or class is just looked for explicitly (for example, a comma is not a special character in regular expressions, so if it is in a regular expression pattern, the regular expression processor will just be looking for a comma in the string, at that point in the pattern).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you want to actually look for one of these reserved characters, it must be escaped, so that, for example, the expression looks for a literal period, rather than the special regular expression meaning of a period. To escape a reserved character in a regular expression, precede it with a back slash ( \".\" ).\n",
    "This results in the regular expression: ^.+,\n",
    "\n",
    "We start at the beginning of the line ( \"^\" ), matching any characters ( \".+\" ) until we come to the literal character of a comma ( \",\" ).\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, to use a regular expression like this to search for matches in a given string, we use the built-in \"re\" package ( https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html ), specifically the \"re.search()\" method. To use \"re.search()\", pass it first the regular expression you want to use to search, enclosed in quotation marks, and then the string you want to search within. \n",
