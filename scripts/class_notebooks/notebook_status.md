# Overview of all notebooks

## 1_3_Variables
- First example of combining Python and SQL: Most of the content is good
- LEHD data will be used
- What should the exercise be?

## 1_4_Variables_Exercices
- Exercise structure is still relevant
- *What should the dataset be?*

## 2_1_Database_clients
- Remove section on the command line
- Rest is still relevant
- Change connection to database

## 2_2_APIs
- *Use same REST API? Perhaps have something KCMO specific?*

## 2_3_data_visualization
- Keep as is

## 3_1_Record_Linkage
- Focus on linking companies from KCMO dataset to Patent dataset to water services data
- Data exploration: look at both business name formats
- Preprocessing: cleaning out legal names in both with RegEx
- Matching: matching the name of the companies
  + Exact matching is easy (on company name and on address)
  + Fuzzy matching more complex: *what other features should be considered?*
- Three types of matching are exact, rule-based and probabilistic. *Should fuzzy matching be treated separately?*

## 4_1_Text_Analysis
- Do on Patent data
- Use patent descriptions

## 4_2_Network Analysis
- Use patent data
  + *Inventors going from one company to another? Or moving around areas?*

## 5_1_Machine_Learning
- Wait for feedback from Rayid on how he wants to run this

## 6_1_Machine_Learning_Recap
- Same as above

## 7_1_Inference_Data_Setup
-
