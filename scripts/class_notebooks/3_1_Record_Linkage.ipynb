    "This notebook will provide you with an instruction into Record Linkage using Python. Upon completion of this notebook you will be able to apply record linkage techniques using the *recordlinkage* package to combine data from different sources in Python. \n",
    "It will lead you through all the steps necessary for a sucessful record linkage starting with data preparation  including pre-processing, cleaning and standardization of data.\n",
    "The notebook follows the underlying lecture and provides examples on how to implement record linkage techniques. \n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is for you to understand the recod linkage techniques. You will be responsible with linking the different datasets in the ADRF, and the subsequent dataset will be used in your later projects."

    "\n",
    "- **Approach**: We will look at the data available to us, and clean & pre-process it to enable better linkage. Since the only identifiers we have for this case study are the names of the firms and addresses, we will have to use string matching techniques, part of Python's record linkage package. \n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of record linkage is to determine if pairs of records describe the same identity. For instance, this is important for removing duplicates from a data source or joining two separate data sources together. Record linkage also goes by the terms data matching, merge/purge, duplication detection, de-duping, reference matching, entity resolution, disambiguation, co-reference/anaphora in various fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to record linkage that include \n",
    "    - exact matching \n",
    "    - rule-based linking \n",
    "    - probabilistic linking \n",
    "- An example of **exact matching** is joining records based on social security number, exact name, or geographic code information. This is what you already have done in SQL by joining tables on an unique identifier. \n",
    "- **Rule-based matching** involves applying a cascading set of rules that reflect the domain knowledge of the records being linked. \n",
    "- In **probabilistic record linkages**, linkage weights are estimated to calculate the probability of a certain match.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical applications you will need record linkage techiques to combine information addressing the same entity that is stored in different data sources. Record linkage will also help you to address the quality of different data sources. For example, if one of your databases has missing values you might be able to fill those by finding an identical pair in a different data source. Overall, the main applications of record linkage are\n",
    "    1. Merging two or more data files \n",
    "    2. Identifying the intersection of the two data sets \n",
    "    3. Updating data files (with the data row of the other data files) and imputing missing data\n",
    "    4. Entity disambiguation and de-duplication"

    "\n",
    "Linking records from different data sources comes with different challenges that need to be addressed by the analyst. The analyst must determine whether or not two entities (individuals, businesses, geographical units) on two different files are the same. This determination is not always easy. In most of the cases there is no common uniquely identifing characteristic for a entity. For example, is Bob Miller from New Yor the same person as Bob Miller from Chicago in a given dataset? This detemination has to be executed carefully because consequences of wrong linkages may be substantial (is person X the same person as the person X on the list of identified terrorists). Pre-processing can help to make better informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-processing can be difficult because there are a lot of things to keep in mind. For example, data input errors, such as typos, misspellings, truncation, abbreviations, and missing values need to be corrected. Literature shows that preprocessing can improve matches. In some situations, 90% of the improvement in matching efficiency may be due to preprocessing. The most common reason why matching projects fail is lack of time and resources for data cleaning. \n",

    "### Regular Expressions - regex\n",
    "Regular expressions (regex) are a way of searching for a character pattern. They can be used for matching or replacing operations in strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining a regular expression search pattern, it is a good idea to start out by writing down, explicitly, in plain English, what you are trying to search for and exactly how you identify when you've found a match.\n",
    "For example, if we look at an author field formatted as \"<last_name> , <first_name> <middle_name>\", in plain English, this is how I would explain where to find the last name: \"starting from the beginning of the line, take all the characters until you see a comma.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regular expression, there are special reserved characters and character classes. For example:\n",
    "- \"`^`\" matches the beginning of the line or cell\n",
    "- \"`.`\" matches any character\n",
    "- \"`+`\" means one or more repetitions of the preceding expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything that is not a special charater or class is just looked for explicitly. A comma, for example, is not a special character in regular expressions, so inserting \"`,`\" in a regular expression will simply match that character in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, in order to extract the last name, the resulting regular expression would be:\n",
    "\"`^.+,`\". We start at the beginning of the line ( \"`^`\" ), matching any characters ( \"`.+`\" ) until we come to the literal character of a comma ( \"`,`\" ).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: if you want to actually look for one of these reserved characters, it must be escaped, so that, for example, the expression looks for a literal period, rather than the special regular expression meaning of a period. To escape a reserved character in a regular expression, precede it with a back slash ( \"`\\`\" ). For example, \"`\\.`\" will match a \"`.`\" character in a string._\n",

The method can be applied to an entire pandas column (replacing expression1 with expression2) with the following syntax: `df['variable'].str.replace(r'expression1', 'expression2')`. Note the `r` before the first expression to signal we are using regular expressions."
