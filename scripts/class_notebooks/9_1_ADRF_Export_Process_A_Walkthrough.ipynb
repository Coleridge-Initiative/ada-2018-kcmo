    "This notebook shows you how to export files from the ADRF. All your exports have to follow this procedure.The ADRF team is working as fast as possible to send you back your results as quickly as possible. Please keep in mind that the export will go more smoothly the more documentation you provide us, and if you prepare your exports according the export guidelines (see Data Privacy and Confidentiality notebook). Depending on how many files you wnat to export the time for export review varies. Thus, we ask you to only export output that you need for you presentation/project report. You can ask all questions related to export on the slack #export-request channel. "

You can find the [export guidelines here](https://applieddataanalyticsprogram.org/export-requests). The most important facts to keep in mind:\n",
    "- All resultes that want to be exported must have an underliying population of 10 indiviuals\n",
    "- For all results being exported you are responsible to show that the statistic is based on 10 or more people\n",
    "- If you export graphs you need to provide the underlying data for the graph. You need to show that every data point you plot is based on 10 ore more observations\n",
    "- Regressions/machine learning: please provide the number of total observations going into the regressions. If your features are dummies please provide frequency counts for each dummy after the regression so we can see how many observations go on each value"
