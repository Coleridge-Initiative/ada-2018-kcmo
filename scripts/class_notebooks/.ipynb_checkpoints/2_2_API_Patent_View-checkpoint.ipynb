    "In this module, we introduce two general ways that one can retrieve data from data sources on the Internet: APIs and web scraping. We've already covered web scraping, and given the messiness of that subject you may find yourself really appreciating the relative simplicity of using APIs - once you grasp the concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for \"Application Programming Interface\". An API is an agreed upon way for one computer program to interact with another computer program.  There are many different kinds of APIs.  Some facilitate interaction between computers over the Internet, some do not. In fact, the Python module SQL Alchemy that we used yesterday is a type of API for talking to databases - you'll see more on APIs for databases with SQL Alchemy later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this session, we focus on web APIs over HTTP that let a user query and retrieve data over the Internet.  This type of API documents an agreed-upon structure and content of requests and responses a program can use to interact with a system.  As long as your code adheres to a system's API, it should be able to reliabily request and receive data from the system.\n",

    "+ In general: APIs ([Application Programming Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)) are \"set[s] of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.\"\n",
    "+ Here we're looking at a **web-API**, a specific type of API which makes it easier to interact with some aspect of a website. In this course, we'll be using APIs to gether data in an automated way - like grabbing a bunch of prior tweets from Twitter. More generally, APIs can also be used to interact with websites in any way the API is designed to. For instance, you can post and delete tweets with Twitter's API, too.\n",

    "## RESTful APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The OTP APIs are what is called \"[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)\" web services. REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer, but don't worry about the acronym so much as the idea. RESTful services adhere to a [series of requirements](https://www.restapitutorial/whatisrest.html) that enable them to be consistent, scalable, reliable, and relatively simple. RESTful APIs allow you to access a pre-defined set of operations through HTTP(S) requests. REST is fantastic because, in part, if you can generate the right URL, you'll always get the right response (this was not always the case with SOAP - the predecessor to REST).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a RESTful API, we'll need to understand (1) how to properly format the request and (2) how to manage and make use of the response from the API. Below we will walk through these concepts while using some of OTP's web services.\n",

We'll introduce JSON slowly, but it's helpful to know that it is oriented around the idea of `key-value` pairs. The `keys` refer to information about the data while the `values` is the data itself. For instance, if you were to translate a tabular dataset into JSON, the column names (and possibly row names/numbers) would become `keys`, while the data in the cells would become `values`. Our JSON response is a `dict` (dictionary), a Python object that we will describe below."
