This Python package implements the standard DBAPI Python interface for interacting with a relational database.  This is the closest you can get to connecting directly to the database in Python - there aren't any objects creating in-memory tables or layers of abstraction between you and the data.  Your Python sends SQL directly to the database and then deals row-by-row with the results.\n",

In practice, DBAPI drivers are about 95% compatible between databases and SQL for some tasks can be different from database to database, so you end up with code that can be ported between databases with a few tweaks and modifications, and then needing to test it all to make sure your SQL works."

    "Next we'll use the [pandas package](http://pandas.pydata.org/) to populate `pandas` DataFrames from the results of SQL queries.  `pandas` uses a `SQLAlchemy` database engine to connect to databases and run queries.  It then reads data returned from a given SQL query and further processes it to store it in a tabular data format called a \"DataFrame\" (a term that will be familiar for those with R or STATA experience).\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrames allow for easy statistical analysis, and can be directly used for machine learning.  They also load your entire result set into memory by default, and so are not suitable for really large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, as discussed in the `SQLAlchemy` section, this is yet another layer added on top of other relatively complex database packages, such that you multiply the potential for a peculiarity in one to cause obscure, difficult-to-troubleshoot problems in one of the other layers.  It won't occur frequently, but if you run into weird or inexplicable problems when turning SQL into DataFrames, try running the SQL using lower layers to isolate the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cell below, we'll use `SQLAlchemy` to connect to the database, then we'll give this engine to pandas and let it retrieve and process data.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: in addition to processing SQL queries, `pandas` has a range of [Input/Output tools](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html) that let it read from and write to a large variety of tabular data formats, including CSV and Excel files, databases via SQL, JSON files, and even SAS and Stata data files. In the example below, we'll use the `pandas.read_sql()` function to read the results of an SQL query into a data frame._\n",
