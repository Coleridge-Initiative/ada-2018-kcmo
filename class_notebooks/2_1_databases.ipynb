Under the hood, `SQLAlchemy` is using `psycopg2` for its PostgreSQL database access, so now you have two relatively complex packages working in tandem.  If you get a particularly vexing bug runing SQL with SQLAlchemy, in particular complex SQL or statements that update or alter the database, make sure to try that SQL with a pure DBAPI client or in the command line client to see if it is a problem with SQLAlchemy, not with your SQL or database.\n",

In the example below, we'll use the `pandas.read_sql()` function to read the results of an SQL query into a data frame._\n",
