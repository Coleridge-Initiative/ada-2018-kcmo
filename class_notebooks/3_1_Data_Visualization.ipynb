    "In the graph above, you can see I set the color of the graph with a pound sign `#` followed by a series of six numbers. This is a hexcode - which is short for hexadecimal code. A hexadecimal code lets you specify one of over 16 million colors using combinations of red, green, and blue. It first has two digits for red, then two digits for green, and lastly two digits for blue: `#RRGGBB`\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, these codes allow for you to specify sixteen integers (thus hexadecimal) for each digit, in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F)\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, it gets easier to read these codes. For instance, above, I used the hex code \"#179809\". Understanding how hex codes work, I can see that there is a relatively low number for red (17) and fairly high number for green (98) and another low number for blue (09). Thus it shouldn't be too surprising that a green color resulted in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools like [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com) and this [Hex Calculator](https://www.w3schoosl.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp) can help you get used to this system.\n",

    "- Back to [Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "The title of a visualization occupies the most valuable real estate on the page. If nothing else, you can be reasonably sure a viewer will at least read the title and glance at your visualization. This is why you want to put thought into making a clear and effective title that acts as a **narrative** for your chart. Many novice visualizers default to an **explanatory** title, something like: \"Average Wages Over Time (2006-2016)\". This title is correct - it just isn't very useful. This is particularly true since any good graph will have explained what the visualization is through the axes and legends. Instead, use the title to reinforce and explain the core point of the visualization. It should answer the question \"Why is this graph important?\" and focus the viewer onto the most critical take-away."

PDFs are a type of vector image, which means all the component of the graph will be maintained.\n",
