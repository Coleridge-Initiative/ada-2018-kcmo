    "- **Learning**: In Machine Learning, you'll hear about \"learning a model.\" This is what you probably know as \n",
    "*fitting* or *estimating* a function, or *training* or *building* a model. These terms are all synonyms and are \n",
    "used interchangeably in the machine learning literature.\n",

    "- **Features**: These are what you probably know as *independent variables*, *attributes*, *predictors*, \n",
    "or *explanatory variables.*\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: This happens when a model is too simple and does not capture the structure of the data well \n",
    "enough.\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: This happens when a model is too complex or too sensitive to the noise in the data; this can\n",
    "result in poor generalization performance, or applicability of the model to new data. \n",
    "- **Regularization**: This is a general method to avoid overfitting by applying additional constraints to the model. \n",
    "For example, you can limit the number of features present in the final model, or the weight coefficients applied\n",
    "to the (standardized) features are small.\n",
    "- **Supervised learning** involves problems with one target or outcome variable (continuous or discrete) that we want\n",
    "to predict, or classify data into. Classification, prediction, and regression fall into this category. We call the\n",
    "set of explanatory variables $X$ **features**, and the outcome variable of interest $Y$ the **label**.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning** involves problems that do not have a specific outcome variable of interest, but rather\n",
    "we are looking to understand \"natural\" patterns or groupings in the data - looking to uncover some structure that \n",
    "we do not know about a priori. Clustering is the most common example of unsupervised learning, another example is \n",

    "- [**Understand the problem and goal.**](#problem-formulation) *This sounds obvious but is often nontrivial.* Problems typically start as vague \n",
    "descriptions of a goal - improving health outcomes, increasing graduation rates, understanding the effect of a \n",

    "that you are trying to optimize?\n",
    "- [**Formulate it as a machine learning problem.**](#problem-formulation) Is it a classification problem or a regression problem? Is the \n",
    "goal to build a model that generates a ranked list prioritized by risk, or is it to detect anomalies as new data \n",
    "come in? Knowing what kinds of tasks machine learning can solve will allow you to map the problem you are working on\n",
    "to one or more machine learning settings and give you access to a suite of methods.\n",
    "- **Data exploration and preparation.** Next, you need to carefully explore the data you have. What additional data\n",
    "do you need or have access to? What variable will you use to match records for integrating different data sources?\n",
    "What variables exist in the data set? Are they continuous or categorical? What about missing values? Can you use the \n",
    "variables in their original form, or do you need to alter them in some way?\n",
    "- [**Feature engineering.**](#feature-generation) In machine learning language, what you might know as independent variables or predictors \n",
    "or factors or covariates are called \"features.\" Creating good features is probably the most important step in the \n",
    "machine learning process. This involves doing transformations, creating interaction terms, or aggregating over data\n",
    "points or over time and space.\n",
    "- **Method selection.** Having formulated the problem and created your features, you now have a suite of methods to\n",
    "choose from. It would be great if there were a single method that always worked best for a specific type of problem. Typically, in machine learning, you take a variety of methods and try them, empirically validating which one is the best approach to your problem.\n",
    "- [**Evaluation.**](#evaluation) As you build a large number of possible models, you need a way choose the best among them. We'll cover methodology to validate models on historical data and discuss a variety of evaluation metrics. The next step is to validate using a field trial or experiment.\n",
    "- [**Deployment.**](#deployment) Once you have selected the best model and validated it using historical data as well as a field\n",
    "trial, you are ready to put the model into practice. You still have to keep in mind that new data will be coming in,\n",

This type of modeling is very useful for *interpretation*.\n",

    "- **We care less about the structure of the model and more about the performance** This means that we'll try out a whole bunch of models at a time and choose the one that works best, rather than determining which model to use ahead of time. We can then choose to select a *suboptimal* model if we care about a specific model type. \n",
    "- **We don't (necessarily) want the model that best fits the data we've *already seen*,** but rather the model that will perform the best on *new data*. This means that we won't gauge our model's performance using the same data that we used to fit the model (e.g., sum of squared errors or $R^2$), and that \"best fit\" or accuracy will most often *not* determine the best model.  \n",
    "- **We can include a lot of variables in to the model.** This may sound like the complete opposite of what you've heard in the past, and it can be hard to swallow.

    "During the first classes, we have explored the data, linked different data sources, and created new variables. \n",
    "A table was put together using similar techniques and writen to the class schema. We will now implement our machine learning model on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A step-by-step description of how we created the table is provided in the notebook \"Data Preparation\" notebook. We encourage you to take a look at this notebook when you have a chance, and understand how the labels and features were generated. An overview of the steps is provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating labels**: Labels are the dependent variables, or *Y* variables, that we are trying to predict. In the machine learning framework, your labels are usually *binary*: true or false, encoded as 1 or 0. This binary variable is named `label`.\n",
    "> In our case, the outcome variable is employer death in the coming year. When the `label` variable is equal to 1, the firm disappeared in the next year. When it is equal to 0, the firm still existed one year later.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decide on feature**: Our features are our independent variables or predictors. Good features make machine learning systems effective. The better the features the easier it is the capture the structure of the data. You generate features using domain knowledge. In general, it is better to have more complex features and a simpler model rather than vice versa. Keeping the model simple makes it faster to train and easier to understand rather then extensively searching for the \"right\" model and \"right\" set of parameters. Machine Learning Algorithms learn a solution to a problem from sample data. The set of features is the best representation of the sample data to learn a solution to a problem.\n",
    "> Here, features include a \"new employer\" flag (whether the firm was created under 5 years ago or not), number of employees, QWI statistics that are generated at company level, and wage metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature engineering** is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem/data/structure  to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.\" ( from [Discover Feature Engineering](http://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/) ).  In text, for example, this might involve deriving traits of the text like word counts, verb counts, or topics to feed into a model rather than simply giving it the raw text. Example of feature engineering are: \n",
    "    - **Transformations**, such a log, square, and square root.\n",
    "    - **Dummy (binary) variables**, also known as *indicator variables*, often done by taking categorical variables (such as city) which do not have a numerical value, and adding them to models as a binary value.\n",
    "    - **Discretization**. Several methods require features to be discrete instead of continuous. This is often done by binning, which you can do by equal width. \n",
    "    - **Aggregation.** Aggregate features often constitute the majority of features for a given problem. These use different aggregation functions (*count, min, max, average, standard deviation, etc.*) which summarize several values into one feature, aggregating over varying windows of time and space. For example, given urban data, we would want to calculate the *number* (and *min, max, mean, variance*, etc.) of crimes within an *m*-mile radius of an address in the past *t* months for varying values of *m* and *t*, and then use all of them as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imputing values to missing or irrelevant data**: Once the features are created, always check to make sure the values make sense. You might have some missing values, or impossible values for a given variable (negative values, major outliers). One option is to treat these values as `NaN`, the other is to impute a value based on the rest of the data. The most common imputation is to replace missing/irrelevant data by the median of the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cleaning data**: When we chose not to impute values, or we are unable to do so, we must get rid of the data's missing values. If some variables contain a lot of `NaN` values, you can choose to drop the variable. If some observations consistently have `NaN` values, you can drop the observations instead. In any case, the final dataset must have no missing variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scaling features**: Certain models will have issue with the distance between features such as age and total earning. Age is typically a number between 0 and 100 while earnings can be number between 0 and 1000000. In order to circumvent this problem we can scale our feature. Scaling brings all values into the range [0,1]."

    "\n",
    "To convince ourselves - and others - that our modeling results will generalize, we need to hold some data back (not using it to train the model), then apply our model to that hold-out set and \"blindly\" predict, comparing the model's predictions to what we actually observed.

Another method is **temporal validation**, which involves building a model using all the data up until a given point in time, and then testing the model on observations that happened after that point. \n",

Generally, if you use the future to predict the past there will be temporal effects that will help the accuracy of your predictions. We cannot use the future to predict the past in real life, so it is important to use `temporal validation` and create our training and test sets accordingly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: it is important to segregate your data based on time when creating features. Otherwise there can be \"leakage,\" where you accidentally use information that you would not have known at the time.*  This happens often when calculating aggregation features; for instance, it is quite easy to calculate an average using values that go beyond our training set time-span and not realize it.  \n"
