    "Networks are mathematical or graphical representations of patterns of relationships between entities. These relationships are defined by some measure of \"closeness\" between individuals, and can exist in an abstract or actual space (for example, whether you are related to someone versus how far away you live from each other). Networks have been used to model everything from airplane traffic to supply chains, and even amorphous materials like window glass, cells, and proteins. They can also be used to model relationships among people. Social networks are patterns of relationships among people or organizations that affect and are affected by actions of individuals within the network. Network analysis captures the effect of the complete pattern of connections among individuals in a group to help us perform structural analysis of outcomes of interest for individuals and the group as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "Networks can be represented as **graphs**, where a graph is made up of **nodes** connected by **ties**. The flexibility of network analysis means that the first step toward analysis is to clearly define what constitutes a node and what constitutes a tie in your network. There are several type of graphs: connected, unconnected, directional, and many more (see [glossary](#Glossary-of-Terms) for a list of terms). \n",

    "- A **node** is an individual entity within a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **tie** is a link between nodes. Ties can be **undirected**, meaning they represent a symmetrical\n",
    "relationship, or **directed**, meaning they represent an asymmetrical relationship (one that doesn't necessarily\n",
    "go both ways). \n",
    "\n",
    "- A directed tie is known as an **arc**. An undirected tie is known as an **edge**.\n",

    "- A **bridge** is a *tie* that cannot be removed without disconnecting the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Two nodes are said to be **reachable** when they are connected by an unbroken chain of relationships through\n",
    "other nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network density** is the number of *actual* connections in a network divided by the number of *potential*\n",
    "connections in that network. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average distance** is the average path length between nodes in a graph. It is a measure of how many nodes \n",
    "it takes to transmit information across the network. This metric is only valid for fully connected graphs. \n",

    "- **Centrality** is the degree to which a given node influences the entire network. "

    "In this tutorial we are going to explore employment patterns of individuals that have recently stoppped receiving tanf benefits. The first step in creating a network is defining the question or questions we want to explore using the network. This then allows us to define what a *node* and *tie* will be. In our case we want to explore employment patterns. A node in our case is a single individual, and a tie will exist between two individuals if they worked for the same employer as determined by the employer's ein number. \n",

    "The following is a SQL script to create a network of all people that exited in 2014 and were employed in the first quarter of 2015. First we are going to create a new table from the `idhs.ind_spells` table as `ada_class3.ind_spells_dates` with the start_date and end_date converted to date columns. This table is quite large so we are going to take of subset of the data and make two tables of people on tanf benefits. One is for people receiving tanf benefits for the last half of 2014 and and the second table if for people receiving tanf benefits for 2015. Then we can do a `LEFT JOIN` to find individuals who no longer received tanf benefits in 2015 that did receive benfits in 2014 and also a second `LEFT JOIN` to grab the `ssn_hash`. We can then grab the wage records for the first quarter of 2015 using the `ssn_hash`. From there we can to a `self-join` and join the table onto itself using the `ein` forming the network. EIN doesn't really tell us anything about the type of job somone has but the legal name of the business will. We can create a table of ein and legal name and join that to our network table.\n",
