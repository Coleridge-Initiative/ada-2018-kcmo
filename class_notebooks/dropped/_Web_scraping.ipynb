In addition, even if a site is OK with you scraping their pages, it is polite to spread your requests at least a few seconds apart, so that you don't put too much load on their servers._"

This means that when we scrape websites, we are most concerned with examining the HTML, rather than the CSS (language for style and aesthetics) or the Javascript (language for interaction). HTML is made up of elements or tags (like `<table>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>`), some of which have attributes (`<a href=\"http://nytimes.com\">Link to the New York Times</a>`).\n",

    "When you scrape web pages for data, you'll be requesting and processing HTML documents.  An HTML document generally has a standard structure, and a set of common tags that have specific, well-known uses.  HTML has also been around a long time and used by a lot of people, however, and so it tends to only be uniform to a point.  Where a good API is simple and consistent, HTML on the web can be all over the place (sometimes called 'tag soup'), from hand-coded documents from the early Internet that aren't even internally consistent to modern sites that don't have HTML at all, just javascript that builds the web page as it runs in the browser.\n",

    "    \n",

It can contain as little or as much HTML as is needed to output a web page's data (from the above simple example to thousands of lines of code).\n",
    "        - the `<h1>` opening tag and `</h1>` closing tag convert the text within it into the bolded header.\n",

This makes them useful for targeting a parser to a specific region of an HTML document.\n",

For sites that dole out piecemeal access to information via a search or filter page, you can often figure out how to talk with the server by creating and submitting form submissions.
