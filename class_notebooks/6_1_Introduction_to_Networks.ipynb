    "Networks are mathematical or graphical representations of patterns of relationships between entities. These relationships are defined by some measure of \"closeness\" between individuals, and can exist in an abstract or actual space (for example, whether you are related to someone versus how far away you live from each other). Networks have been used to model everything from airplane traffic to supply chains, and even amorphous materials like window glass, cells, and proteins. They can also be used to model relationships among people. Social networks are patterns of relationships among people or organizations that affect and are affected by actions of individuals within the network. Network analysis captures the effect of the complete pattern of connections among individuals in a group to help us perform structural analysis of outcomes of interest for individuals and the group as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "Networks can be represented as **graphs**, where a graph is made up of **nodes** connected by **ties**. The flexibility of network analysis means that the first step toward analysis is to clearly define what constitutes a node and what constitutes a tie in your network. There are several type of graphs: connected, unconnected, directional, and many more (see [glossary](#Glossary-of-Terms) for a list of terms). \n",

    "\n",
    "- A **node** is an individual entity within a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **tie** is a link between nodes. Ties can be **undirected**, meaning they represent a symmetrical\n",
    "relationship, or **directed**, meaning they represent an asymmetrical relationship (one that doesn't necessarily\n",
    "go both ways). \n",
    "\n",
    "- A directed tie is known as an **arc**. An undirected tie is known as an **edge**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **cutpoint** is a *node* that cannot be removed without disconnecting the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A **bridge** is a *tie* that cannot be removed without disconnecting the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Two nodes are said to be **reachable** when they are connected by an unbroken chain of relationships through\n",
    "other nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network density** is the number of *actual* connections in a network divided by the number of *potential*\n",
    "connections in that network. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average distance** is the average path length between nodes in a graph. It is a measure of how many nodes \n",
    "it takes to transmit information across the network. This metric is only valid for fully connected graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Centrality** is the degree to which a given node influences the entire network. "

    "In this tutorial we are going to explore networks of employers in the high-tech industry. The first step in creating a network is defining the question or questions we want to explore using the network. This then allows us to define what a *node* and *tie* will be. In our case we want to explore employment patterns for these companies. A node in our case is a employer in a high-tech industry, and a tie will exist between two employers if they employed the same employee. An employer is determined by the company's EIN number (these numbers are hashed here), and an employee is determined by the individual's (hashed) SSN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the SQL script used to create the networks that we will work on in this notebook. \n",
    "First we are going to create a new table `kcmo_ada.mo_tech_wage_2016` of high-tech jobs in 2016. There has been extensive research relating to the identification of high-tech jobs from wage-record data (See [Goldschlag and Miranda, 2016](https://www2.census.gov/ces/wp/2016/CES-WP-16-55.pdf)). One robust methodology developed by Bureau of Labor Statistics economist Daniel Hecker ([Hecker, 2005](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/07/art6full.pdf)) determines a list of high-tech NAICS codes - we will use this methodology here. We first use the `kcmo_lehd.mo_qcew_wages` table to determine a list of EIN numbers associated with these NAICS codes. We then do a `LEFT JOIN` from the `kcmo_lehd.mo_wages` table, restricted to the year 2016, to find all high-tech jobs in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use 3 methodologies to generate 3 different employer networks.\n",
    "- The first, named `kcmo_ada.tech_network_2010_Q1`, looks only at the firsts quarter of 2016. Two employees A and B are connected in this network only if there is an employee who worked for both employers in Q1 of 2016.\n",
    "- The second, named `kcmo_ada.tech_network_2010_anyQ`, looks at any of the 4 quarters of 2016. In this case, if an employee worked for both employers A and B in any one of the 4 quarters of 2016, the employers will be connected.\n",
    "- The third, named `kcmo_ada.tech_network_2010`, look at the entire year 2016. Two employers A and B are connected so long as an employee worked for both firms that year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL script is detailed with notes below. Note that every person has the same EIN so in the final steps of the script we remove \"self-ties\" by EIN (`WHERE ein_l = ein_r`). Employers can have their EIN's change over time, so we also remove \"self-ties\" by legal name (`WHERE legal_name_l = legal_name_r`). Finally, we remove entries where EIN, SSN, or legal name is `NULL`."
