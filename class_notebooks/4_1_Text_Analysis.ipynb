    "**Text analysis** is used to extract useful information from or summarize a large amount of unstructured text stored in documents. This opens up the opportunity of using text data alongside more conventional data sources (e.g. surveys and administrative data). The goal of text analysis is to take a large corpus of complex and unstructured text data and extract important and meaningful messages in a comprehensible way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text analysis can help with the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Information Retrieval**: Find relevant information in a large database, such as a systematic literature review, that would be very time-consuming for humans to do manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering and Text Categorization**: Summarize a large corpus of text by finding the most important phrases, using methods like topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Create category-sensitive text summaries of a large corpus of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Translation**: Translate documents from one language to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to analyze patent descriptions using topic modeling. We will examine he content of the different patents and develop a way of clustering patents by key words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will...\n",
    "* Learn how to transform a corpus of text into a structured matrix format so that we can apply natural language processing (NLP) methods\n",
    "* Learn the basics and applications of topic modeling\n",
    "* Learn how to do document tagging and evaluate the results\n",

    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "### Glossary of Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Glossary of Terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corpus**: A corpus is the set of all text documents used in your analysis; for example, your corpus of text may include hundreds of research articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenize**: Tokenization is the process by which text is separated into meaningful terms or phrases. In English this is easy to do for individual words, as they are separated by whitespace; however, it can get more complicated to  automate determining which groups of words constitute meaningful phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming**: Stemming is normalizing text by reducing all forms or conjugations of a word to the word's most basic form. In English, this can mean making a rule of removing the suffixes \"ed\" or \"ing\" from the end of all words, but it gets more complex. For example, \"to go\" is irregular, so you need to tell the algorithm that \"went\" and \"goes\" stem from a common lemma, and should be considered alternate forms of the word \"go.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TF-IDF**: TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) is an example of feature engineering where the most important words are extracted by taking account their frequency in documents and the entire corpus of documents as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Topic Modeling**: Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning method where groups of words that often appear together are clustered into topics. Typically, the words in one topic should be related and make sense (e.g. boat, ship, captain). Individual documents can fall under one topic or multiple topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **LDA**: LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is a type of probabilistic model commonly used for topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stop Words**: Stop words are words that have little semantic meaning but occur very frequently, like prepositions, articles and common nouns. For example, every document (in English) will probably contain the words \"and\" and \"the\" many times. You will often remove them as part of preprocessing using a list of stop words.\n"

For instance, a patent on a new medical robot would fall under the topic \"robotics\" as well as the topic \"medicine\". The set of topics used by a document is known as the document's allocation, hence, the name Latent Dirchlet Allocation, each document has an allocation of latent topics allocated by Dirchlet distribution.

For example, if you want to find all email addresses in a document, you might look for everything that looks like *some combination of letters, _, .* followed by *@*, followed by more letters, and ending in *.com* or *.edu*. If you want to find all the credit card numbers in a document, you might look for everywhere you see the pattern \"four numbers, space, four numbers, space, four numbers, space, four numbers.\" Regexes are also helpful if you are scraping information from websites, because you can use them to separate the content from the HTML code used for formatting the website.\n",

Any developer should keep in mind there is a trade-off between optimization and understandability. The general philosophy of programming in Python is that your code is meant to be as understandable by *people* as much as possible, because human time is more valuable than computer time. You should therefore lean toward understandability rather than overly optimizing your code to make it run as quickly as possible. Your future-self, code-reviewers, people who inherit your code, and anyone else who has to make sense of your code in the future will appreciate it. \n",

For example, the words *the* and *of* are totally ubiquitous, so they won't serve as meaningful features, whether to distinguish documents from each other or to tell what a given document is about. You may also run into words that you want to remove based on where you obtained your corpus of text or what it's about.

    "Previously, we used topic modeling to infer relationships between social service facilities within the data. That is an example of unsupervised learning: we were looking to uncover structure in the form of topics, or groups of agencies, but we did not necessarily know the ground truth of how many groups we should find or which agencies belonged in which group.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we turn our attention to supervised learning. In supervised learning, we have a *known* outcome or label (*Y*) that we want to produce given some data (*X*), and in general, we want to be able to produce this *Y* when we *don't* know it, or when we *only* have *X*. \n",

    "In order to produce labels we need to first have examples our algorithm can learn from, a \"training set.\" In the context of text analysis, developing a training set can be very expensive, as it can require a large amount of human labor or linguistic expertise. **Document classification** is an example of supervised learning in which want to characterize our documents based on their contents (*X*). A common example of document classification is spam e-mail detection. Another example of supervised learning in text analysis is *sentiment analysis*, where *X* is our documents and *Y* is the state of the author. This \"state\" is dependent on the question you're trying to answer, and can range from the author being happy or unhappy with a product to the author being politically conservative or liberal. Another example is *part-of-speech tagging* where *X* are individual words and *Y* is the part-of-speech. \n",

    "Recall from the machine learning tutorial that we are seeking the find the most general pattern in the data in order to have to most general model that will be successful at classifying new unseen data. Our previous strategy above was the *Out-of-sample and holdout set*. With this strategy we try to find a general pattern by randomly dividing our data into a test and training set based on some percentage split (e.g., 50-50 or 80-20). We train on the test set and evaluate on the test set, where we pretend that we don't have the labels for the test set. A significant drawback with this approach is that we may be lucky or unlucky with our random split, and so our estimate of how we'd perform on truly new data is overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. A possible solution is to create many random splits into training and testing sets and evaluate each split to estimate the performance of a given model. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more sophisticated holdout training and testing procedure is *cross-validation*. In cross-validation we split our data into *k* folds or partitions, where *k* is usually 5 or 10. We then iterate k times. In each iteration, one of the folds is used as a test set, and the rest of the folds are combined to form the training set. We can then evaluate the performance at each iteration to estimate the performance of a given method. An advantage of using cross-validation is all examples of data are used in the training set at least once. \n",
