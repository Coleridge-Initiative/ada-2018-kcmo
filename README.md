# Applied Data Analytics training program – Kansas City, MO (2018)

The [Coleridge Initiative](coleridgeinitiative.org)'s Applied Data Analytics training program focused on Local Economic Development and Job Creation in Kansas City, Missouri.

The program was generously sponsored and hosted by The Kauffman Foundation.

## Class Overview and Projects

The Coleridge Initiative Applied Data Analytics Training Program is designed to equip public policy professionals with advanced computer science and data science skills. The program provides a hands-on introduction to data analytics topics ranging from basic SQL and Python coding to running and interpreting machine learning models. Application to real-world issues is key to the organization of the program – the present Training Program in Kansas City, MO explored local economic development and job creation.

During the program, participants were grouped into teams in which they scoped and executed a project related to Economic Development and/or Job Creation. Two template projects were prepared in advance for participant reference and can be found in the [Sample Projects folder](https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/ada-2018-kcmo/tree/master/sample_projects).
- The project `mo_dashboard` creates an interactive dashboard to track economic development metrics at county level across the state of Missouri and on the border with Illinois. The visualized metrics include typical employment statistics such as total jobs and average wages, as well as the more advanced QWI metrics.
- The project `predict_business_vitality` builds a machine learning model to predict which employers survive in the following years based on firm characteristics, industrial sector, and geography. Potential applications include intervention on failing firms and identification of weakening industries.

Participant teams usually worked off of one of the template projects – restricting to a cohort of interest or improving the models with additional features. All teams presented their results on June 28th and 29th, 2018.


## Data Available for Class
